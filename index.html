					<h2>Elizabeth Goff the Software Engineer</h2>
					<p>Full Stack Software Engineer</p>
				</header>
				<div class="content">
					<p>As a software engineer and stoneware artist, I have the opportunity to enhance space visually and bring out the true
						potential of the expression that is brought forth. I not only have the privilege of creating the actual designs, but
						also help sculpt a person’s vision and bring it to life. Bringing my clients’ uniqueness that helps them stand out
						of the crowd is something I truly enjoy.</p>
					<p>I have been a professional artist for the last 10 years, operating all aspects of Living Earth Creations Inc. Prior
						to that, I had 20 years of experience in management as well as business. Now, as a Full Stack Software Engineer, I
						have experience in HTML, CSS, React, Redux, Material-UI, Axios, JavaScript, jQuery, Postico, postgresSQL, NodeJS, Express,
						Visual Studio Code, Atom, AJAX, AngularJS, Angular Material, Bootstrap, MongoDB, Robo3T, Trello, Postman, Mocha, Chai,
						GitHub, Git, and Heroku. That being said, I am also experienced in product development, product photography and branding,
						marketing, design, guest service, public speaking, teaching, training, sales growth, profit and loss, labor and inventory
						management, operations, crisis management, quality control, sales, and much more.</p>

						<h3>MSP TechHire</h3>
						<p>This full stack application for MSP TechHire is for tracking data of partners in their program to be used for reports, fundraising, and analyzing the success rate of the program.
							In working with MSP TechHire we helped our client with public facing visibility, design, as well as the database structures, and functionality.
							This has been an exciting opportunity to help the cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul. </p>

						<p>One of the best things about being a Full Stack Software Engineer is the continual collaboration in the tech community.
						I feel very lucky to be a part of such a dynamic, and ever changing field, where the people are so supportive and involved. Each day I learn something new!</p>
